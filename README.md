### Full Stack Software Engineer 
Denovo Ventures,
Jan. 2018 – Present

* Provided continuous software development support for a proprietary IT
services management application within a team of 4 DevOps engineers. Used
agile processes and the latest JavaScript frameworks to build a reliable, highly
robust web application used by over 200 major companies.

* Integrated Google Analytics with our proprietary ITSM website to track
application usage. Gathered metrics such as unique external customer page
views, average time on page, and average page load time to enhance website
features, improve performance, and increase user retention.

* Saved internal support staff valuable time by developing a front-end tooltip
creation module integrated with a NoSQL database. The tooltips fostered
business efficiency by making it less necessary for customers to contact the
support team with technical questions.

* Wrote various applications in ServiceNow, a cloud-based SaaS tool that
provides data storage and defect management services. Developed email
handler code to automatically create incidents by parsing high priority inbound
emails from external customers.

* Reduced the effort required to test software releases by creating automated
tests for application features using Chai and Mocha. The tests leveraged a
Node library which provided an API to control headless Chrome. Test results
validated technical functionality and were saved in a MongoDB collection.
